          <h1>Work</h1>
        <p>
          I am currently the <strong>Head of Technology and Incubation</strong> at <strong class="color-accent">Zinc
            Collective</strong>
          where I lead pilot programs and technical partnerships to address infrastrucurte gaps in the Democratic
          political ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sit on the <strong>Advisory Board</strong> of <strong class="color-accent">Higher Ground Labs</strong>, an accelerator that invests in early-stage political tech companies and convenes the creators and users of innovative tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was the <strong>Director of Engineering</strong> for <strong class="color-accent">President Joe
            Biden</strong> on the 2020 campaign where I lead a team of software and infrastructure engineers that powered the
          campaign that defeated Donald Trump [TKTKTKKT say more here].
        </p>
        <p>
          I was a <strong>Senior Software Engineer </strong> on <strong>The Groundwork</strong> platform, which served as the application and
          infrastrucutre system that powered the 2016 presidential campaign of <strong class="color-accent">Secretary Hillary Clinton</strong>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I was an <strong>Infrastructure Engineer</strong> at <strong class="color-accent">Datadog</strong> where I architected and implemented the internal platform for Incident Response management, which was eventually developed into the suite of customer product offerings.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was a <strong>Senior Mobile Engineer</strong> at <strong class="color-accent">LISNR</strong>, where I developed the product's first iOS SDK for an ultrasonic data transport protocol.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was a <strong>Senior Mobile Engineer</strong> and <strong>Scrum Master</strong> at <strong class="color-accent">Cardinal Solutions</strong>, with a team that built Vantiv Accept - a mobile credit card processing application.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a <strong>Named Inventor</strong> on an <strong class="color-accent">Augmented Reality Patent Application</strong> (US20140092241A1) for a "device and method for scanning of books and other items for order and inventory control".
        </p>
        <p>
          I maintain an <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> Twitter bot called <strong class="color-accent">Campaign Email AI</strong> that was built on a text-generating neural network. It was trained on hundreds of thousands of real campaign emails from the Princeton Corpus of Political Emails, and attempts to generate new campaign email subject lines. It serves as both an experiment and an art project to demostrate the shortcomings of AI-driven voter outreach.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been an <strong>Election Night Reporter</strong> for <strong class="color-accent">Decision Desk HQ</strong>. [TKTKTK]
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been a frequent <strong>Contributor</strong> to <strong class="color-accent">OpenElections</strong>. [TKTKTK]
