            I am currently the <strong>Executive Director</strong> of <strong>Zinc Labs</strong>, a political
            innovation lab at <strong class="color-accent">Zinc
              Collective</strong> that houses the organization's strategic work in Democratic technology and pilot
            programs. Through our
            network of campaigns, committees, vendors, donors, and subject matter experts, we incubate and invest in
            innovative new programs across the ecosystem. We prioritize investing in technology and people to enable
            collaborative
            experimentation, technical execution, and hypothesis testing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I sit on the <strong>Advisory Board</strong> of <strong class="color-accent">Quiller</strong>, an Artificial
            Intelligence copilot that helps Democrats draft and deploy high quality, effective fundraising content. In
            this capacity, I contribute product, technology, and political guidance to the Quiller leadership team.
          </p>
          <p>
            I sit on the <strong>Advisory Board</strong> of <strong class="color-accent">Higher Ground Labs</strong>, an
            accelerator that invests in early-stage political tech companies. In this capacity, I contribute strategic
            guidance to the Higher Ground Labs leadership team, and provide both political and technical advice to
            investment cohort companies.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was the <strong>Director of Engineering</strong> for <strong class="color-accent">President Joe
              Biden</strong> on his 2020 presidential campaign. I joined the campaign in July of 2019, and served in
            that role through the duration of the primary and general election cycles. I led a team of software,
            infrastructure, and security engineers, which was charged with delivering innovative new campaign tech
            for headquarters and states programs. We shipped dozens of internal and voter-facing products, including an
            in-house peer-to-peer texter, a relational organizing app, a real-time debate transcription service, a
            document and media ingestion and indexing library, a live donation tracking web service, a distributed
            soft-reporting
            platform, the JoeBiden.com web property, hundreds of ETL pipelines, and a cross-region data warehouse.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was a <strong>Senior Software Engineer </strong> on <strong>The Groundwork</strong> platform, which served
            as the application and
            infrastructure system that powered the 2016 presidential campaign of <strong class="color-accent">Secretary
              Hillary Clinton</strong>. Beginning in 2015, I was the primary engineer for multiple campaign-enabling web
            services for event signups, single-click donations, and peer-to-peer fundraising.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was an <strong>Infrastructure Engineer</strong> at <strong class="color-accent">Datadog</strong> where I
            architected and implemented the internal platform for Incident Response management. This tool eventually
            joined the suite of observability offerings available to customers. My team also implemented the
            organization's first templated deployment pipeline for the organization's global transition to Kubernetes.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was a <strong>Senior Mobile Engineer</strong> at <strong class="color-accent">LISNR</strong>, where I
            developed the product's first iOS SDK for the ultrasonic data transport protocol. In 2014 the team joined
            the TechStars accelerator. This toolchain was
            originally designed to allow musicians to embed inaudbile data streams into their media. Over time, it
            became a location-aware second screen immersion platform for music festivals, professional sporting events,
            and feature films. It now serves as a payment protocol in partnership with VISA.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was a <strong>Senior Mobile Engineer</strong> and <strong>Scrum Master</strong> at <strong
              class="color-accent">Cardinal Solutions</strong>, with the team that built Vantiv Accept - a mobile credit
            card processing application. Envisioned as a competitor to Square, the application was deployed to retail
            and grocery point-of-sale systems across the country.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a <strong>Named Inventor</strong> on an <strong class="color-accent">Augmented Reality Patent
              Application</strong> (US20140092241A1) for a "device and method for scanning of books and other items for
            order and inventory control". We created a mobile application that scanned a shelf
            of books in real-time as a user viewed it through the screen. If it identified any items out of order, it
            overlayed the user's view of the item with a red X to indicate a misplacement, and then povided directional
            guidance of where it should be moved.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been an <strong>Election Night Reporter</strong> for <strong class="color-accent">Decision Desk
              HQ</strong>. I gathered live results from New Mexico and Ohio Boards of Elections offices to report
            real-time data as they were delivered from precincts. These results were featured on Vox and BuzzFeed
            election night coverage.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have been a frequent <strong>Open Source Contributor</strong> to <strong
              class="color-accent">OpenElections</strong>,
            which is creating the first free, comprehensive, standardized, linked set of election results data for the
            United States.
