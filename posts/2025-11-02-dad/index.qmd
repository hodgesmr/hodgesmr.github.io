On **October 22, 2025** we got the call from Kelsey's OBGYN that we were going to the hospital that night. The due date wasn't until November 17, but it was time to go. We checked in to Labor and Delivery at **10:00 pm CT**.

On **October 24, 2025** at **9:08 am CT**, our daughter **Lena** was born. Lena's birthday [is `1024`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1024_(number)).

Kelsey became a mom. I became a dad.

I love Lena so much. I love Kelsey so much.

Lena was admitted to the [NICU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neonatal_intensive_care_unit) at **11:30 am CT** for oxygen support due to [respiratory distress syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_respiratory_distress_syndrome). She was put on [CPAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_positive_airway_pressure#Pre-term_infants) with an [NG tube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_intubation).

Kelsey remained on bed rest with postpartum medication and monitoring for the next 24 hours.

On **October 25, 2025** at **2:30 pm CT** we saw on Lena's [cam](https://www.angeleyehealth.com/) that she was ready to eat her first meal without the NG tube. We began visiting the NICU every three hours to do so.

On **October 26, 2025** at **8:30 am CT** Lena came off oxygen support and was breathing all by herself. At around **12:00 pm CT** Kelsey was discharged from the hospital.

We then moved into a [Ronald McDonald Family Room](https://rmhc-ctx.org/) down the hall from the NICU so that we could continue visiting and feeding. What an amazing support resource for families.

On **October 27, 2025** at **12:45 pm CT** Lena was discharged from the NICU and everyone got to come home.

Many families go through so much more in the NICU. We are so grateful for Lena's strength and progress.

For almost a week now, the three of us have been home, happy, and healthy.

We decided that, for now, photos will stay on family devices.

Kelsey and I are extremely fortunate to have the comfort and security to take the next few months away from work, together.

I deleted Slack off my phone. Its place on my Home Screen is now occupied by a diaper and feeding logging app. I love that.

This post isn't for anyone in particular. It's for me. It's for us.

I am so happy to be home with my family.

I love Lena so much. I love Kelsey so much.
