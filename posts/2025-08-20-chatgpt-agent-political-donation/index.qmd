Last month OpenAI announced [ChatGPT Agent](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-agent/) which, among many other things, acts like rubbing LLM onto [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/). Since the announcement, I wanted to try making a political donation right there in the chat without building any of my own API or MCP or custom agentic operator weirdware.

It mostly worked:

It Bing'd for Sherrod Brown's website, waited for the page to load, found the donation button for $50, clicked it, navigated through the credit card flow, saw that there was a form that needed more information about me, and handed control back to me to complete the task. Here's what that looked like:

I felt a little hesitant typing my credit card info into ChatGPT's little VNC iframe, so I set up a temporary virtual card (a free service offered by my credit card provider) that auto-expired after a single charge.

This flow is exactly what I expected, but it likely can be automated further. OpenAI claims that [the agent holds on to cookies across sessions](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11752874-chatgpt-agent#h_d9ad0b50af), so I imagine that if I had previously authenticated to ActBlue in a chat, and had [ActBlue Express](https://support.actblue.com/donors/help/actblue-express-accounts/), the automated session would have just charged the card without my intervention. I didn't try it.

All the standard "what about..." apply here: How do I know the agent found the proper donation form? How do I know it didn't set up recurring donations? How do I know it selected $50 and not $500? How do I know I didn't end up on a malicious site prompt-injecting me to donate to Jon Husted instead? Yes, all the things. In this case, I know because the agent handed control back to me and I checked. But a more-automated flow might not have given me that opportunity.

A lot of the discourse around AI and LLMs tends to leave out the idea that all of this is a UX paradigm shift. I'm eager to see how these tools mature and how political campaigns can innovate voter contact.
