It can't be a cliche because it actually can't be over-said: working on the Biden Campaign has been both the hardest and most rewarding experience of my career. It's a rare opportunity to work on something you care deeply about, with amazing people, and to succeed. I said it in 2016, and in 2018, and I'll say it again in 2020: the tech was never the point. I'm immensely proud of the work we did. The world will never fully understand the mountains that this scrappy team was able to move.

To those who invited me in: thank you. To those who pushed me: thank you. To those who pushed with me: thank you.

What's next? I'm going to sleep for a while. I don't know what's after that, but I won't be stepping away from the fight for democracy, justice, and a better world.
