    "text": "This post explores some basic ideas of the Lambda Calculus, and how to use it to implement a computation system with it. We will define numbers and operators from scratch, and use that to implement the square_sum function.\nIf you’re new to the Lambda Calculus, or functional programming in general, you may wish to start with some of these resources:\n\nDavid Beazley’s Lambda Calculus from the Ground Up - PyCon 2019\n\nIf you’re someone who learns well by watching and listening, I highly recommend that you watch this talk. A significant portion of the concepts below come from watching this talk more than once.\n\nBen Eater’s Making a computer Turing complete\nLambda Calculus | Wikipedia\nCurrying | Wikipedia\n\nThis post assumes you are fairly familiar with Python and Python’s lambda expressions.\n\nRules of Our System\nThe Lambda Calculus asserts that any computational system can be implemented with a set of three simple rules: * You can define variables * You can define single-argument functions * You can call single-argument functions\nThat’s it. No numbers. No operators. No control flow. No data structures.\nI find it fascinating that with these very minimal concepts, the Lambda Calculus asserts that we can create a fully functional computer! This is, of course, a very minimal explanation of the rules of the Lambda Calculus, and I invite you to consult the references above for more information and formal definitions!\n\n\nThe Challenge\nUsing the rules described above, we want to create a system that can calculate the square-sum of any inputs. Again, we only have single-argument functions. That means we have no integers, no addition, and no multiplication. We’re going to have to create those using nothing but single-argument functions that accept single-argument functions as input and can only return single-argument functions.\nFor reference, consider the square_sum function, that may be written in Python as:\n\ndef square_sum(a, b):\n    return (a*a) + (b*b)\n\n\nsquare_sum(5, 2)\n\n29\n\n\n\nCurrying\nAs previously mentioned, our computation system requires that we can only create functions and those functions must accept one and only one argument. This may seem like a limiting requirement, but let’s take a look at what we can do with the idea of Currying — a method for transforming multi-argument functions into a chain of single-argument functions. This allows us to re-write our Python implementation as:\n\ndef square_sum(a):\n    def inner(b):\n        return (a*a) + (b*b)\n    return inner\n\n\nsquare_sum(5)(2)\n\n29\n\n\nIn our curried version above, square_sum accepts the first argument, a and returns a function that accepts the second argument, b. We can then call that returned inner function to complete our calculation. Currying is a fundamental strategy for computation in the Lambda Calculus.\n\n\n\nOur Basic Building Block\nUnless you’re already familiary with the Lambda Calculus, or you’re a veteran of functional programming, you’re probaby very accustomed to computing by operating on state. You have data structures, or numbers, or bits, and you operate on them and then you persist new data structures, or numbers, or bits.\nOur concept of integers is a perfect example. As children, we learned that the concept of 3 can be represented by holding up three fingers on our hand, and seeing all three of them, and pointing to them. The Lambda Calculus asks us to adjust that concept away from state and towards behavior. Instead of holding up three fingers, what if we held up one finger three times. It may be harder for us see that idea of 3, but it is a representation of 3 nonetheless.\nSit with this idea of behavior representing integers, because behavior will be how we represent everything. And in our system, functions are behavior. Our function could be the act of holding up a finger, pressing a button, or anything else we need it to be.\nLet’s use that metaphor of pressing a button. The button press is our behavior, and behaviors are functions. And arguments are functions. And we can only return functions. So, let’s write that:\n\ndef button_press(f):\n    def g(x):\n        return f(x)\n    return g\n\nNot much to see here yet. In fact, our system isn’t designed to see anything. It’s designed to do computations within a given set of rules.\nWe’re designing a system of computation, and we can think about this system like instruction that run on a CPU. But we’re humans, and it’s helpful for us to be able to see the results of our computation in ways that we can understand. So, we’re going to introduce an external system that is not within the Lambda Calculus, but can interface with it. Think of this as a peripheral like a printer. It’s not used to do any of our computation. It can do special things that our CPU can’t do, and it’ll connect to our system as a function, because our system can only work with functions.\nLet’s pretend our system has a printer attached that can only print the * character. We’ll interface with it via an emit function.\nHere is our not-of-our-system emit function:\n\ndef emit(func):\n    def asterisk(x):\n        return f'{x}*'\n    return func(asterisk)('')\n\nThis is kindof strange. Our external emit function takes in some function and has an inner asterisk-generating function. Let’s hook it up to our button_press function:\n\nemit(button_press)\n\n'*'\n\n\nWhat just happened here? We call our emit function (external from our system) by passing in our button_press function (internal to our system). We did it one time, and it yielded a single *. Again, this is just a convenience interface so that we can see what’s going on, and isn’t necessary to do any of our actual computation.\n\n\nNumbers\nAbove we began to describe how functions, or behaviors, can represent numbers. A single call to button_press yielded some concept of 1. What if we didn’t think about it as one call to button_press anymore, but as the idea of one behavior:\n\ndef ONE(f):\n    def g(x):\n        return f(x)\n    return g\n\nemit(ONE)\n\n'*'\n\n\nIf you’ve made it this far, you’re probably thinking, “Hey, Python has a way to represent single-argument functions, and they’re called lambdas!” Let’s start using that instead of the expanded button_press function:\n\nONE = lambda f : lambda x : f(x)\n\nemit(ONE)\n\n'*'\n\n\nCool. So we know how to represent the concept of 1 using only single-argument functions. We can represent 2 by calling our function twice, because in our system numbers are behaviors:\n\nTWO = lambda f : lambda x: f(f(x))\n\nemit(TWO)\n\n'**'\n\n\nThis is all well and good, but we’re not really going to try to implement every single number are we? That wouldn’t make a very good computer. How can we represent all countable numbers?\nIf you look closely at our definitions above, ONE is a single call to f(), while TWO is f(f()). This means that if we’re at any given number, we can get to the next number by calling f() again. We can define an INCREMENT() function to do just that. I find it helpful to start by looking at this through the expanded Python functions first:\n\ndef ONE(f):  # f is the behavior we want to do\n    def g(x):  # x is the curried second argument\n        return f(x)\n    return g\n\n\ndef INCREMENT(n):  # n is the concept of the number we already have\n    def g(f):  # f is the behavior we want to do\n        def h(x):  # x is the curried second argument\n            return f(n(f)(x))  # we call f() again on our n(f)(x)\n        return h\n    return g\n\n\nemit(INCREMENT(ONE))\n\n'**'\n\n\nSpend some time stepping through the above code to understand it. We’re essentially wrapping nested functions as many times as we need to get to the next number. Once you’ve wrapped your head around it, see that we can re-write the above as lambdas:\n\nONE = lambda f : lambda x : f(x)\n\nINCREMENT = lambda n : lambda f : lambda x : f(n(f)(x))\n\nTWO = INCREMENT(ONE)  # our calculated TWO from ONE\n\nemit(TWO)\n\n'**'\n\n\nIf we can calculate TWO from ONE, we can calculate THREE:\n\nTHREE = INCREMENT(TWO)\n\nemit(THREE)\n\n'***'\n\n\nPretty neat! We can keep doing this to infinity, either by saving values, or calculating them on the fly! But you may be wondering, what about ZERO? Well, we’ve defined ONE as a single call to any behavior f(), so ZERO would simply be no calls to that behavior:\n\nZERO = lambda f : lambda x : x\n\nemit(ZERO)\n\n''\n\n\nSee how ZERO doesn’t call f() at all? What’s fun here is that we no longer need to have defined ONE, we can calculate it from ZERO!\n\nONE = INCREMENT(ZERO)\n\nemit(ONE)\n\n'*'\n\n\n\n\nOperators\nNow that we know we can represent numbers as function calls, let’s start working on math operators. We’ve already introduced one critical operator, INCREMENT, and we can use that to introduce others. Let’s start with ADD. Addition is can be thought of as incrementing M times on a number N. For example, 2 + 3 could be described as incrementing 2, three times. Before we attempt to implement that in our system, let’s look again to how we would Curry this in Python:\n\ndef add(a):\n    def inner(b):\n        return a + b\n    return inner\n\nadd(2)(3)\n\n5\n\n\n\ndef ADD(a):  # Our first number, which is always a function\n    def inner(b):  # Our second number, which is always a function\n        return b(INCREMENT)(a)  # Increment a, b times\n    return inner\n\n\nFIVE = ADD(TWO)(THREE)\nemit(FIVE)\n\n'*****'\n\n\nSince everything is always a function, our numbers can be used not only as representations of calculations, but also as executors. Here’s our ADD as a lambda:\n\nADD = lambda a : lambda b: b(INCREMENT)(a)\n\nFIVE = ADD(TWO)(THREE)\nemit(FIVE)\n\n'*****'\n\n\nThe last missing operator of our computational system multiplication. Multiplication should feel a lot like nested functions you see often in programming.\n\ndef MULT(a):  # Our first number, which is always a function\n    def outer(b):  # Our second number, which is always a function\n        def inner(f):  # The function we want to do a*b times\n            return b(a(f))  # do f, a times, and do that b times\n        return inner\n    return outer\n\nSIX = MULT(TWO)(THREE)\nemit(SIX)\n\n'******'\n\n\nAgain, we can represent MULT as a lambda:\n\nMULT = lambda a : lambda b : lambda f : b(a(f))\n\nSIX = MULT(TWO)(THREE)\nemit(SIX)\n\n'******'\n\n\n\n\nUsing Our Computer\nWe’ve now defined everything necessary to implement our square_sum function in the Lambda Calculus. Let’s build it here from these basic principles. We want to calculate square_sum(5, 2).\n\nZERO = lambda f : lambda x : x\nINCREMENT = lambda n : lambda f : lambda x : f(n(f)(x))\nADD = lambda a : lambda b: b(INCREMENT)(a)\nMULT = lambda a : lambda b : lambda f : b(a(f))\n\nsquare_sum = lambda a : lambda b : ADD(MULT(a)(a))(MULT(b)(b))\n\nTWO = ADD(INCREMENT(ZERO))(INCREMENT(ZERO))\nFIVE = INCREMENT(ADD(TWO)(TWO))\n\nRESULT = square_sum(FIVE)(TWO)\n\nAnd that’s it! Using nothing but single-argument lambda functions, we’ve successfully defined non-negative integers, the addition and multiplication operators, and the square-sum function. It’s a little hard to visualize, but the actual answer is calcuated in our RESULT variable. We can output it to our metaphorical printer:\n\nemit(RESULT)\n\n'*****************************'\n\n\nOur printer has output 29 asterisks! Pretty cool!\n\n\nWhat’s Next?\nOur system barely scratches the surface, but you can continue to implement more operators, comparators, control flow, and everything else you might need for a full computer. I highly recommend consulting the references at the top of the post for further reading!\n\n\nLicense\nCopyright (c) 2022, Matt Hodges\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this\n  list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,\n  this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation\n  and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n* Neither the name of Exploring the Lambda Calculus with Python nor the names of its\n  contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from\n  this software without specific prior written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE\nDISCLAIMED.

    "text": "At this point there’s nothing novel in pointing out that news and politics has devolved into an entertainment competition. But I can’t become so numb to let last week’s Republican National Convention go without comment.\nI won’t get into detailed summaries or link to videos. The Republican National Convention, unsurprisingly, was rife with jingoism, xenophobia, and hate. But what stood out was a primetime performance on the final night:\n\n\n\nHulk Hogan ripping his shirt off during the 2024 Republican National Convention\n\n\nIf you missed the social media frenzy, the short version is Hulk Hogan took the stage during a primetime speech to say, among many pernicious things:\n\nBut what happened last week, when they took a shot at my hero, and they tried to kill the next president of the United States, enough was enough! And I said, ‘Let Trump-A-Mania run wild brother! Let Trump-A-Mania rule again!’\n\nAnd then he ripped off his shirt and the stadium of suited leaders of the Republican party lost their minds in cheers and applause. Never mind that pundits and Republican leaders assured us that — after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump days prior — this convention would be a message of national unity. Never mind whoever the they are that he’s talking about. Hulk Hogan gave the people what they wanted: a viral-worthy performance that makes you feel something when you press share.\nThis moment exemplified a broader issue that has been gradually intensifying. The disgraced former president, after all, is a reality TV character, epitomizing the entertainment-driven nature of modern politics. To note that is not to minimize the harm he has inflicted and will inflict if given another chance. But it’s an apt time to highlight a recurring misdiagnosis of modern Conservative power.\n\nOur Misdiagnosis of Conservative Power\nAs astute online big-brains, we’re frequently high-fiving ourselves for naming the Right’s methods and tactics as Orwellian (despite the fact that most people haven’t actually read Nineteen Eighty-Four). We get those small hits of dopamine by labeling our eroding rights as such. But by and large, power-building of the Trump era isn’t Orwellian at all. Just as Donald Trump himself isn’t Machiavellian at all (a core tenet from The Prince is a firm warning against flatterers — Donald Trump could never). Yes, the Right does deploy assaults that could be lifted directly from Orwell or Bradbury — look no further than the book-banning crusades or the “do not believe what you see” lies from the press briefing rooms. But when evaluating how we got here and why we’re stuck here, it’s instructive to look to Neil Postman’s observations in Amusing Ourselves to Death:\n\nBut we had forgotten that alongside Orwell’s dark vision, there was another - slightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling: Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World. Contrary to common belief even among the educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley’s vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think. What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one. Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism. Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance. Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy. As Huxley remarked in Brave New World Revisited, the civil libertarians and rationalists who are ever on the alert to oppose tyranny “failed to take into account man’s almost infinite appetite for distractions.” In 1984, Orwell added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure. In short, Orwell feared that what we fear will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we desire will ruin us.\n\nI’m not particularly interested in arguing that “we’re living in a dystopia, actually”. Despite our collective addiction to devices that incessantly tell us that the world is terrible, I still believe things are getting better over time. And I largely reject the, “no one has had it as bad as we have it” notions from my generational cohort. But we can only pursue the long arc of progress if we continue to care enough to do so. If I was architecting a #resist movement of 2024, it would be to resist the trivialization of political power.\nIt’s important to reflect on Huxley’s and Postman’s ideas, even if it makes us uncomfortable. So many people today claim they’ve stopped consuming news altogether, but often they simply switch to more entertaining sources that don’t feel like homework. Consider this: how many of your friends can name a single Supreme Court justice without hints? You should start asking! This exercise, which I’ve conducted socially, reveals fascinating results! These observations aren’t about intelligence — they’re about priorities.\nAgain, I don’t think I’m pointing out anything novel here. Pundits analyze political events in terms of “energy” and base success on Nielsen viewership metrics. Matt Gaetz and Ted Cruz both have side gigs as podcast hosts. Marjorie Taylor Greene dresses up as Cruella de Vil to scream during the Statue of the Union.\n\n\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene dressed up as Cruella de Vil to scream during the Statue of the Union\n\n\nIt’s all incredibly stupid. And it’s helpful to have an appropriate label for what’s been happening for a long time.\nSo, when Hulk Hogan took to the stage to frivolously transport the Right’s power-holders back to the 1980s while ripping off his shirt, exalting “Trump-A-Mania” (aptly named), it couldn’t be more clear that ambient Conservative power-building is Huxleyan, not Orwellian. We are amusing ourselves entirely to death.\nSeems bad."
